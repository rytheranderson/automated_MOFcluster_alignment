# automated_MOFcluster_alignment
## Authors

- Ryther Anderson

## Motivation
This collection of scripts can extract metal clusters from MOFs, cap any hanging-bonds, and align molecules with open metal sites.

## Current Status
This is just a collection of scripts that have yet to be unified. The node extractor has been tested successfully on the CoRE MOF database. T
The node capping function has been tested on a diverse set of 40 clusters. The adsorbate alignment has been tested for paddlewheels only. 

## Usage
Currently you will just have to read to code to see how it works, I will make it more user friendly when I get time.
